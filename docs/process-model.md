# Porjects - How do they work?

Opin allows users to create organisations and projects inside those organisations. Those projects are
participatory processes, build up by participation modules and phases. 

## Purpose of this document

In this document we try to describe exactly what a projects is. It should be understanable by developers, non-technical stuff and user with good knowledge of the platform.

## Data model of a project

Each project has some meta data, that will always be present. It needs to have a name, a
description, information if it is private and at least one moderator. It can have an image and, a
background image. If it is private it also might have participants.

In euth a project is made up by a collection of particiaption modules. Each participation module has
phases that can be activated or deactivated. For our example there exists only one participation
module called 'idea collection'. It offers the following phases:

  1. Add ideas:
   - particpants can add ideas
  2. Add and comment ideas:
   - participants can add ideas
   - participatns can comment ideas
  3. Offline idea workshop:
   - moderator can upload ideas from offline meeting
  4. Comment ideas:
   - participatns can comment ideas
  5. Rate and commment ideas:
   - participatns can comment ideas
   - participatns can vote ideas
  6. Rate ideas:
   - participants can rate ideas
  7. Offline rate:
   - moderator can upload rates from offline meeting
  8. Offline jury selection:
   - moderator can upload labels/statments from offline jury meeting

When a participation module is added to a project all phases will be added. The intiator can then disable
phases that she doesn't need. She can also set a title, set a desription, add start date, and
add end date for each phase.

Start and end dates of a phase should never overlap with another phase of all participation modules
in the same project. The might be ommited, in that case the phase needs to be manually switches. If that
happens the end date of the prvious phase and the start date of the new phase will be set. The active
phase is that phase that has a start date in past and a end date in the future or a start date in the past 
but no end date set. There can be one or no active phase.

To make this less theoretical, lets give the representation of an example project:

- project
   - Name: Build a new tree house.
   - Description:
      We want a new tree house in our garden and invite all neighbours and family members to design that tree house.
      
      In order to be cheap and sustainable the tree house should be build from recycleable
      materials.
      
      First we collect cool ideas for elements that a tree house should have (like rope ladder, fountain, 
      bucket shower).
       
      Than you can add your proposal by drawing a concept study. Through rate and jury
      decision the best one will be selected and than realized.
