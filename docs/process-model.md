# Porjects - How do they work?

Opin allows users to create organisations and projects inside those organisations. Those projects are
participatory processes, build up by participation modules and phases.

## Purpose of this document

In this document we try to describe exactly what a projects is. It should be understanable by developers, non-technical stuff and user with good knowledge of the platform.

## Data model of a project

Each project has some meta data, that will always be present. It needs to have a name, a
description, information if it is private and at least one moderator. It can have an image and, a
background image. If it is private it also might have participants.

In euth a project is made up by a collection of particiaption modules. Each participation module has
phases that can be activated or deactivated. For our example there exists only one participation
module called 'idea collection'. It offers the following phases:

  1. Add ideas:
   - participants can add ideas
   - participants can updated, delete thier own ideas
   - participants can comment ideas
  2. Rate ideas:
   - participatns can comment ideas
   - participatns can vote ideas
  3. Comment ideas:
   - participatns can comment ideas
  4. Universal:
   - participants can add ideas
   - participants can updated, delete thier own ideas
   - participants can comment ideas
   - participants can vote ideas


(The last one is for compatibility with the old platform)

When a participation module is added to a project all phases will be added. The intiator can then disable
phases that she doesn't need. She can also set a title, set a desription, add start date, and
add end date for each phase.

Start and end dates of a phase should never overlap with another phase of all participation modules
in the same project. If a project is not in draft mode all dates should be set, but they might be
changed by the moderators. The active phase is the phase which starts earlier than the current date
and ends later.

To make this less theoretical, lets give the representation of an example project:

- project
   - Name: Build a new tree house.
   - Information:
      We want a new tree house in our garden and invite all neighbours and family members to design that tree house.

      In order to be cheap and sustainable the tree house should be build from recycleable
      materials.

      First we collect cool ideas for elements that a tree house should have (like rope ladder, fountain,
      bucket shower).

      Than you can add your proposal by drawing a concept study. Through rate and jury
      decision the best one will be selected and than realized.
