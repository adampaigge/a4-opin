**Contet Management System (CMS)**:
The Opin Platform consists of the platform itself, meaning the part where users can add, edit, delete organisations, projects, modules, phases, ideas, comments, ratings, reports etc. as well as of descriptive webpages that give more information on the platform, such as imprint, help and how to's. As these webpages should be editable by a user a Content Management System (CMS) is used. For this project the Wagtail CMS used. Major advantage of this CMS is that it builds up upon the Webframework Django which is also used for the OPIN Platform. Because of that it is possible, that users who are logged in on the platform and also have rights to access the CMS-Administration interface, do not have to log in again.

**Feature,Tool, or Method**:

**Moderator**:
Moderators are defined for each project, this means one user can be moderator of several projects at the same time. Moderators of a project can update the project settings and - if the project is private - invite and add participants to the project. They also receive a message, if a comment within this project was reported and can decide if the comment needs to be deleted. Depending on the modules and phases within in the project, thy have additional rights, e.g. create the document for a commenting text module.

Participants are defined for each project, this means one user can be participant of several projects at the same time. If a project is private a user needs to be invited or added to the project by a moderator in order to become participant. In public projects all users are free to participate and therefore participants of the project.

**Tab**:
Tabs are user interface elements used to group content together. Having several tabs next to each other creates a Tab group, where one Tab at a time can be activated to show its content. On Opin, we use Tabs to group content on the project detail page together ("Information, "Participation", "Result").

---
**Templates or Blueprints**:
Blueprints are used to let initiators choose a set of premade phases with defined features (commenting, rating, adding proposals, etc.). These blueprints are used to establish a standard of projects.

---
**Timeline**:
A design element used to show the chronological process of a Project. It is shown on the project detail page and highlights the active phase. It groups all phases to their modules, displaying further information about every phase (name, start/end date, whether it's active).

---
**User**:
After a User has registered to the platform he/she can participate in public projects or private projects he/she is invited in through creating proposals/collecting ideas, commenting or rating proposals, as well as editing his/her own content. Users can also be made initiators of an organisation by the owner or another initiator of the organisation. They can also be added as moderators to projects. Within the content management system (CMS) they can be added to the moderators and/or the editors group. Users can also receive administrator rights. By that they achieve access to the administrator interface, which allows them to add organisations and add, update or delete all available resource types on the platform.

---
**WISYWIG**:
A kind of editor where the user can immediately see the styles (bold, italics, links, images, etc.) that are applied to text. In Opin we are using the CKEditor for user generated content.
